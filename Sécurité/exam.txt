Epreuve Secu Réseau : Diffie-Hellman key exchange

You decided to intercept a conversation between Mrs Van Den Schriek and Mr Noël, hoping you will catch a few exam questions.
Unfortunately, their exchange had been ciphered but you dont have any information about the protocol.
While reading some frames on WireShark, you notice the following one, that hold your attention :

	- TLSv1.2 Record Layer: Handshake Protocol: Server Key Exchange
		Content Type: Handshake
		Version: TLS 1.2 (0x0303)
		- Handshake Protocol: Server Key Exchange
			Handshake Type: Server Key Exchange
			- Diffie-Hellman Server Params
				Implementation: original-content (multipicative group of integers)
				p Length: 3
				p: 131
				g Length: 1
				g: 7
				Signature Hash Algorithm: *x****
				Signature Length: ******
				Signature: *********************************************
				
You also know that Mr Noël change his Private Key at each exhange, while Mrs Van Den Schriek keeps always the same Private Key.
By mistake, this key got leaked, and you eared that she always uses the key "17".

You succeeded to catch a message sent from Mr Noël to Mrs Van Den Schriek : 
47 63 2 6 16 31 44 17 59 41 123 123 41 3 17 50 68 67 67 48 74 31 17 99 40 17 68 116 99 48 101

Will you be able to break the ciphering protocol ?
